Welcome to our project repository for predicting voids in friction stir welding using machine learning techniques. This ReadMe file will provide you with an overview of the project, its goals, and the necessary steps to set it up and run it successfully.

PROJECT REVIEW

Friction stir welding (FSW) is a widely used technique in the manufacturing industry for joining materials with high strength and durability. However, the presence of voids in FSW can compromise the quality and integrity of the welds. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of voids in FSW, allowing for early detection and preventive measures.
